# Testcase Example:  '[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]'
#
# Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point
# at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints
# of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with
# x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
# 
# Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In
# this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is
# 49.

# Example:

# Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
# Output: 49

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        i = 0
        j = len(height) - 1
        maxA = 0
        while(i < j):
            temp = min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i)
            if (temp > maxA):
                maxA = temp
            if height[i] < height[j]:
                i = i + 1
            else:
                j = j - 1
        
        return maxA
